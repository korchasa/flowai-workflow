# SDS Engine — Subsystems (phase, process, binary, backoff, release)


### 3.2 Phase Registry (`state.ts`) — IMPLEMENTED (FR-E9, FR-E59)

- **Status:** Implemented. `state.ts::PhaseRegistry` is a per-run instance
  holding a private `Map<string, string>`. `Engine.runWithLock` builds a
  fresh `PhaseRegistry.fromConfig(this.config)` at run start and threads it
  through `getNodeDir`/`buildTaskPaths` and the `EngineContext`.
- **Purpose:** Map `nodeId → phase string` for the duration of one
  `Engine.run()`, enabling `getNodeDir` to resolve phase-aware artifact
  paths. Per-run lifetime is mandatory for library-mode hosts that drive a
  sequential queue of `Engine.run()` calls in one Deno process — module-
  scoped state would let Run A's mapping leak into Run B (FR-E59).
- **Data:** Private `Map<string, string>` per instance. Populated from a
  `WorkflowConfig` via exactly one mechanism (mutual exclusivity enforced
  by config validation — FR-E33).
- **Interfaces:**
  - `static PhaseRegistry.fromConfig(config: WorkflowConfig): PhaseRegistry`
    — exclusive if/else: if `config.phases` exists, iterates phase→nodeIds
    mapping; else iterates config nodes and builds map from
    `nodeId → node.phase` (skips nodes without `phase`).
  - `static PhaseRegistry.empty(): PhaseRegistry` — used by callers without
    a phase mapping (legacy tests, dry-run summaries).
  - `instance.get(nodeId: string): string | undefined` — lookup.
  - `getNodeDir(runId, nodeId, workflowDir, phaseRegistry?)` — when
    `phaseRegistry` is present and maps `nodeId → phase`, returns
    `${runDir}/${phase}/${nodeId}/`; otherwise the flat
    `${runDir}/${nodeId}/` (back-compat for callers that omit the
    registry).
  - `buildTaskPaths(runId, nodeId, inputs, workflowDir, phaseRegistry?)` —
    threads the same registry into every `node_dir` and `input.<id>`
    computation so loop-body and predecessor paths inherit the active
    mapping consistently.
- **Deps:** `types.ts` (`WorkflowConfig`, `NodeConfig`).
- **Design rationale:** Per-run instance over module-level state because
  the engine is library-embeddable. Hosts run sequential `Engine.run()`
  calls; module-level mutable state would leak phase mappings across
  runs and silently misroute artifacts. Path helpers stay free
  functions (no capture of `this`) so legacy unit tests with no
  registry continue to compile and produce flat paths — the registry
  parameter is optional. Within one run, the registry is read-only:
  `Engine.runWithLock` builds it before `ensureRunDirs` and never
  mutates it again.

### 3.3 Process Registry (`process-registry.ts`) — IMPLEMENTED (FR-E25, FR-E60, FR-E61)

- **Status:** Implemented. FR-E25 + FR-E60 + FR-E61.
- **Purpose:** Track spawned `Deno.ChildProcess` instances and shutdown
  callbacks; enable graceful cleanup on `killAll()`. Two scoping modes
  coexist: a package-wide default singleton (back-compat with stand-alone
  CLI use) and instance-scoped `ProcessRegistry` instances supplied by
  embedding hosts (FR-E60).
- **Data:** `Set<Deno.ChildProcess>`, `Array<() => Promise<void> | void>`,
  configurable `graceMs` per instance — owned by `@korchasa/ai-ide-cli`.
  Engine's `process-registry.ts` only re-exports the `ProcessRegistry`
  class plus the default-singleton free functions
  (`register`/`unregister`/`onShutdown`/`killAll`).
- **Interfaces (instance-scoped):**
  - `new ProcessRegistry({ graceMs? })` — construct.
  - `register(p)` / `unregister(p)` — add/remove tracked process.
  - `onShutdown(cb): () => void` — register cleanup callback (returns
    disposer).
  - `killAll()` — SIGTERM all, wait `graceMs`, SIGKILL survivors, run
    callbacks.
- **Interfaces (free functions over default singleton):** Same names; they
  delegate to the package-wide default `ProcessRegistry` instance. Used by
  `Engine.run()` itself for its own `onShutdown(() => releaseLock(...))`
  hook so stand-alone CLI behavior is byte-for-byte identical.
- **Engine option flow (FR-E60):**
  `EngineOptions.processRegistry?` → `node-dispatch.ts` →
  `runAgent({...processRegistry})` / `handleAgentHitl({...})` /
  `runHitlLoop({...})` → forwarded to every `adapter.invoke()` call as
  `RuntimeInvokeOptions.processRegistry`. The ai-ide-cli adapters route
  spawned subprocesses to the supplied instance instead of the default.
  When the field is omitted at the top, every downstream invoke also sees
  `undefined` and the default singleton is used.
- **Signal handler boundary (FR-E61):** `installSignalHandlers()` lives in
  engine's local `process-registry.ts` and is exposed publicly, but it is
  NOT called by `Engine`. It exists exclusively for autonomous bin entry
  points (`cli.ts`, `scripts/self-runner.ts`). Embedding hosts own
  SIGINT/SIGTERM routing themselves and translate signals into
  queue-cancellation, not `Deno.exit`. Source-level invariant verified by
  `engine_test.ts::engine.ts does not import installSignalHandlers`.
- **Integration points:**
  - `agent.ts::runAgent` — forwards `processRegistry` to every
    `adapter.invoke()` (initial + continuation).
  - `engine.ts::Engine.run()` — `onShutdown(() => releaseLock(...))` for
    SIGINT/SIGTERM cleanup (default singleton); does NOT call
    `installSignalHandlers()`.
  - `cli.ts`, `self-runner.ts` — `installSignalHandlers()` at entry point
    (bin-mode only).
- **Design rationale:** The default singleton preserves bit-for-bit
  stand-alone CLI behavior. The opt-in `processRegistry` field gives
  embedding hosts a per-run kill scope — calling `killAll()` on the
  host's instance terminates only this engine's children, leaving any
  sibling subprocesses (chat dispatcher, scheduler, MCP server) intact.
  Signal wiring stays out of `Engine` so a host that already owns
  SIGINT/SIGTERM (most do — they translate signals into UI-level
  cancellation, not `Deno.exit`) is not blindsided by an engine call to
  `Deno.exit(130|143)`.

### 3.3c Parent-Death Watchdog (`parent-watchdog.ts`) — FR-E83

- **Status:** Implemented.
- **Purpose:** Keep the two long-lived stdio MCP entrypoints
  (`runMcpServer`, `runFlowaiHitlMcpServer`) from leaking as `ppid=1`
  orphans when the ACP host that spawned them dies non-gracefully (no
  SIGTERM, no stdin EOF). Polls the parent PID; once reparented to
  init/launchd it runs `killAll()` + `Deno.exit(143)`.
- **Interfaces:**
  - `parentIsOrphaned(getParentPid = () => Deno.ppid): boolean` — pure
    predicate, `getParentPid() === 1`. Injectable for tests.
  - `installParentDeathWatchdog({ intervalMs?, getParentPid?,
    onParentDeath? }): { stop() }` — `setInterval` poll (default 5 s)
    that fires `onParentDeath` exactly once then clears its timer; the
    timer is `Deno.unrefTimer`'d so it never keeps the loop alive on its
    own. Default `onParentDeath` = `killAll().finally(() =>
    Deno.exit(143))`.
- **Integration points:** `mcp-server.ts` stdio branch installs after
  `server.connect` and `stop()`s on transport close; `hitl-mcp-server.ts`
  installs at entry and `stop()`s in a `finally`. The test transport path
  (`options.transport`) installs no watchdog.
- **Deps:** `process-registry.ts` (`killAll`).
- **Design rationale:** `Deno.ppid` poll is the portable baseline (covers
  macOS, the observed leak host); Linux-only `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` is out of
  scope. Injectable `getParentPid`/`onParentDeath` keep the logic unit-
  testable without real reparenting or `Deno.exit`.

### 3.3a Workflow Lock (`lock.ts`) — FR-E25, FR-E54

- **Status:** Implemented.
- **Purpose:** Serialize concurrent runs **per workflow folder** (`<workflowDir>` =
  directory containing `workflow.yaml`). Distinct workflow folders own
  independent lock files and run in parallel.
- **Path contract:** `defaultLockPath(workflowDir) = "<workflowDir>/runs/.lock"`.
  The engine derives `workflowDir` once via `deriveWorkflowDir(options.config_path)`
  in the `Engine` constructor and passes it to `defaultLockPath` at acquisition
  time. `EngineOptions.lock_path` override (tests only) bypasses the derivation.
- **Lock content (`LockInfo`):** `{ pid, hostname, run_id, started_at,
  renewed_at? }`. Hostname is a decision input, not a diagnostic: a readable
  lock file does NOT imply a shared PID namespace, because the runs
  directory can outlive the namespace that wrote it (Kubernetes hostPath,
  docker volume, reboot with the lock on a network disk). A PID from a
  foreign namespace names an unrelated local process, which is why liveness
  is a lease the holder refreshes (FR-E102).
- **Liveness (`isLockHolderAlive`, FR-E102):** one predicate, two arms.
  Same host — or a lock with no `hostname`, a shape `readLockInfo` still
  accepts — uses `Deno.kill(pid, "SIGCONT")`: only `NotFound` (`ESRCH`)
  proves a dead PID, while `PermissionDenied` (`EPERM`) means the process
  exists under another user and counts as alive. A live PID is then
  qualified by a fresh lease when the lock carries one, which catches a
  reboot that reissued the PID; a lock without `renewed_at` predates the
  lease and is decided by the PID alone. Foreign host ignores the PID and
  reads the lease only, falling back to `started_at` for a pre-lease lock.
  A stamp more than one lease window in the future is unusable, so clock
  skew on a dead node cannot hold the folder.
- **Lease timing:** `LOCK_RENEW_INTERVAL_MS` 15 s, `LOCK_LEASE_MS` 45 s —
  three renewals, so a single failed write never costs a live run its lock,
  and an abandoned lock blocks the folder for at most that long.
- **Interfaces:**
  - `defaultLockPath(workflowDir: string): string` — pure helper, returns
    `<workflowDir>/runs/.lock`.
  - `acquireLock(lockPath, runId)` — returns the `LockInfo` it published, so
    the caller can renew and release without a second read that could fail
    while the lock is already held. Throws when a live holder has the file;
    reclaims on dead PID; rewrites on `SyntaxError` (corrupted file).
    Publication is ATOMIC: the payload is staged in a sibling temp file and
    linked into place with `Deno.link`, so the lock name appears only when
    its content is complete. A read-then-write shape let two racers both
    conclude the folder was free; `Deno.open({createNew})` alone is not
    enough either — it publishes an empty file that a racer reads as
    corrupt debris, deletes, and then acquires.
  - `releaseLock(lockPath)` — idempotent unconditional unlink. Used by
    `acquireLock` to drop debris it has just judged dead.
  - `releaseLockIfOwned(lockPath, info)` — unlinks only while `info` still
    names the holder. This is the run's own release path: the lease makes it
    possible to lose the lock while still alive, and an unconditional unlink
    there would delete the lock of the run that reclaimed the folder,
    handing it to a third run.
  - `startLockRenewal(lockPath, info, opts?)` — refreshes `renewed_at` on an
    unref'd interval, staging a sibling temp file and `Deno.rename`-ing it
    into place. Renewal must overwrite, and `Deno.link` cannot, which is why
    creation and renewal use different primitives. A `stopped` flag is
    re-checked after every await, because `stop()` cannot recall a tick
    already past its read. Transient read/write failures retry on the next
    tick; losing ownership calls `onLost` and stops.
  - `readLockInfo(lockPath)` — debug helper.
- **Integration points:**
  - `engine.ts::Engine.run()` — `defaultLockPath(this.workflowDir)`,
    `acquireLock` before any side-effecting work, then `startLockRenewal`.
    Teardown stops renewal BEFORE releasing, on both the `finally` path and
    the `onShutdown` SIGINT/SIGTERM path, and releases through
    `releaseLockIfOwned`. A lost lease is recorded and re-thrown after the
    graph finishes, so a run never reports success while another run owns
    the folder.
  - `mcp-server.ts::cancel_run` — refuses to signal a holder whose hostname
    is not this host; that PID names an unrelated local process.
  - `scripts/sdlc-status.ts` — imports `isLockHolderAlive` rather than
    probing PIDs itself, so the reporter cannot disagree with the engine.
- **Cross-workflow parallelism:** Each workflow folder owns its
  `<workflowDir>/runs/<run-id>/` umbrella, which holds both per-run state
  (FR-E9) and the per-run git worktree (FR-E57: `runs/<run-id>/worktree/`,
  superseding the pre-FR-E57 repo-global `.flowai-workflow/worktrees/`
  namespace). Per-folder locking aligns the concurrency unit with the
  artifact-namespace boundary. No global serialization point remains.
- **Legacy:** Pre-FR-E54 binaries used a fixed `.flowai-workflow/runs/.lock`
  path. After upgrade, that file is orphaned (never consulted) and may be
  deleted manually. No automatic migration.

### 3.4 Binary Distribution (`scripts/compile.ts`) — FR-E39

- **Status:** Pending.
- **Purpose:** Cross-platform standalone binary compilation via `deno compile`.
  Eliminates Deno prerequisite for end users.
- **Compile Script** (`scripts/compile.ts`):
  - Accepts `--target <triple>` for single-target or no args for all 4 targets.
  - Targets: `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`,
    `x86_64-apple-darwin`, `aarch64-apple-darwin`.
  - Output naming: `flowai-workflow-<os>-<arch>` (e.g., `flowai-workflow-linux-x86_64`).
  - Invokes: `deno compile --target <t> --env VERSION=<v> --output <name>
    src/cli.ts` per target.
  - `--version` flag value: reads `VERSION` env var, falls back to `"dev"`.
- **deno.json task:** `"compile": "deno run -A scripts/compile.ts"`.
- **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`):
  - Trigger: `push` with `tags: ["v*"]`.
  - Matrix strategy: 4 jobs (one per target triple).
  - Each job: checkout → setup Deno → `deno task compile --target <triple>`
    → upload artifact.
  - Final `release` job (`needs: [build]`): download all artifacts → create
    GitHub Release (`GITHUB_REF_NAME` as tag) → attach binaries.
  - Version string: extracted from `GITHUB_REF_NAME` (strips `v` prefix),
    passed via `VERSION` env to compile script.
- **Deps:** Deno compile toolchain, GitHub Actions.
- **Design rationale:** Compile script is both local-dev tool (`deno task
  compile`) and CI building block. Matrix CI parallelizes builds (~1× instead
  of 4× wall time). Version embedding via `--env` avoids code generation or
  build-time file patching.

### 3.5 Shared Backoff Utility (`scripts/backoff.ts`) — FR-E28

- **Status:** Pending.
- **Purpose:** Single authoritative source for exponential backoff logic used by
  `scripts/self-runner.ts`. Eliminates duplicated `nextPause()` function and
  associated constants.
- **Exports:**
  - `MIN_PAUSE_SEC` (60) — minimum pause / reset value on success.
  - `MAX_PAUSE_SEC` (14400) — 4h cap.
  - `BACKOFF_FACTOR` (2) — multiplier per iteration.
  - `nextPause(current: number): number` — returns
    `Math.min(current * BACKOFF_FACTOR, MAX_PAUSE_SEC)`.
- **Consumers:** `self-runner.ts` — imports `nextPause` and `MIN_PAUSE_SEC`
  (used for pause reset on success).
- **Tests:** `scripts/backoff_test.ts` — 3 tests (doubling, max cap, min floor)
  moved from `self-runner_test.ts`.
- **Deps:** None (pure function, no imports).

### 3.5 Binary Compile Script (`scripts/compile.ts`) — FR-E39

- **Status:** Pending.
- **Purpose:** Cross-platform binary build via `deno compile`. Generates
  self-contained executables for distribution without Deno on target.
- **Targets:** 4 platform tuples as constant array:
  `[{os: "linux", arch: "x86_64", denoTarget: "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"},
   {os: "linux", arch: "arm64", denoTarget: "aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu"},
   {os: "darwin", arch: "x86_64", denoTarget: "x86_64-apple-darwin"},
   {os: "darwin", arch: "arm64", denoTarget: "aarch64-apple-darwin"}]`
- **Output:** `dist/flowai-workflow-<os>-<arch>` per target.
- **Flags:** `--allow-all` (engine needs Deno.Command, env, file I/O).
  Entry: `cli.ts`.
- **CLI:** `--dry-run` prints commands without executing.
- **Tests:** `scripts/compile_test.ts` — target list, filename convention,
  dry-run behavior.
- **Deps:** Deno std only (no external).

### 3.6 Release CI Workflow — FR-E39, FR-E41

- **Purpose:** Automated release pipeline: check, version bump, compile, publish.
- **One workflow, staged jobs** (`ci.yml`, on push to any branch + PRs +
  `workflow_dispatch`): `deno task check` and plugin-install acceptance →
  `release` job decides the bump level, tags, pushes → matrix compile →
  `sync-plugins` → `publish-github` (release notes via
  `scripts/generate-release-notes.ts`, assets `dist/*`) + `publish-jsr`.
  Every job past `release` is gated on `needs.release.outputs.released`.
- **Bump level:** decided by `scripts/release-level.ts` over the commits of
  `<last-tag>..HEAD`, then forced with `--release-as`. `feat` → MINOR,
  `fix`/`perf`/`refactor`/`build`/`engine`/`engine+sdlc` → PATCH, everything
  else (including `sdlc` and a typeless merge subject) → no release. A
  breaking change is capped at MINOR while the version is `0.x` and becomes
  MAJOR from 1.0.0 on. `commit-and-tag-version` MUST NOT decide this: its own
  pre-1.0 semantics release a `feat` as a PATCH, which shipped FR-E99 as
  0.9.2. `workflow_dispatch` accepts `release_as` to force a level by hand.
- **Version bumping:** `.versionrc.json` configures `commit-and-tag-version`
  (npm package). Updates the `deno.json` version field and generates
  `CHANGELOG.md`. Task: `deno task release`.
- **Release notes:** `scripts/generate-release-notes.ts` — parses conventional
  commit subjects between tags, categorizes (feat/fix/refactor/perf/docs/build),
  generates markdown with GitHub compare link.
- **Assets:** 4 binaries named `flowai-workflow-<os>-<arch>`.


### 3.7 Plugin Precondition + Release Binary Distribution — FR-E78

- **Purpose:** Replace the FR-E74 launcher with a documented engine
  precondition. The plugin's `.mcp.json` invokes `flowai-workflow mcp`
  directly; the operator installs the binary once on PATH (release
  asset with `.sha256` sidecar, or `deno install -A
  jsr:@korchasa/flowai-workflow`).
- **Dispatch flow:**
  - Host MCP client reads
    `<plugin-root>/.mcp.json` → spawns `flowai-workflow mcp`.
  - `cli.ts mcp` (no positional) calls
    `resolveActiveWorkflow({ env: Deno.env.toObject() })`:
    `$FLOWAI_WORKFLOW` → exactly-one or `github-inbox` default under
    `<cwd>/.flowai-workflow/` → `null`. The engine reads no
    host-specific env (`CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`,
    etc.) — the plugin's `.mcp.json` pins `cwd` per host so the
    project-root signal stays in one place.
  - On `null`, the server is invoked in no-workflow mode; tool calls
    return a structured missing-workflow diagnostic so the MCP
    handshake still completes.
- **Binary distribution channel:** `scripts/targets.json` lists five
  triples (adds `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` →
  `flowai-workflow-windows-x86_64.exe`); the CI `build` matrix
  compiles each target, generates a `<artifact>.sha256` sidecar via
  `sha256sum`, and uploads both via a multi-path `actions/upload-artifact`
  step. The existing `publish-github` job's `gh release create … dist/*`
  glob picks both files up atomically.
- **Payload classification:** `scripts/build-plugin-payload.ts::classifyPayloadFile`
  returns `null` for `plugin-src/shared/bin/launch.ts` and for every
  engine-source file (root `*.ts`, `deno.json`). The payload shrinks
  to skills + agents + bundled `.flowai-workflow/<name>/` + host
  manifests and `.mcp.json`.
- **Windows scope caveat:** FR-E78 guarantees only that
  `flowai-workflow mcp` starts and answers `initialize` +
  `tools/list` on Windows. Workflows that use `before`/`after` shell
  hooks or HITL `ask_script`/`check_script` still depend on POSIX
  `sh` and are out of scope (separate FR track).
- **Supersedes:** FR-E74 (launcher + lazy compile retired).



### 3.8 Test Runtime Seam (`testing/fake-runtime.ts`) — FR-E86

- **Status:** Implemented. FR-E86.
- **Purpose:** Run whole workflows with no agent. `EngineOptions.runtimeAdapter`
  overrides the adapter for every agent invocation of a run; `createFakeRuntime`
  builds one from a TypeScript handler.
- **Injection path:** 6 sites. `EngineOptions.runtimeAdapter` →
  `node-dispatch.ts` (`runAgent`; all THREE `handleAgentHitl` sites —
  top-level resume, top-level detect, loop-body detect; `runLoop`) →
  `LoopRunOptions.runtimeAdapter` → `loop.ts` `runAgent` →
  `hitl-handler.ts` → `hitl.ts`. Every site already had
  `runtimeAdapter ?? getRuntimeAdapter(runtime)`, so omission preserves
  production behaviour byte-for-byte.
- **Regression-lock coverage is partial.** Mutation-deleting each injection
  site and running the suite kills only 2 of 6: `runAgent` in
  `node-dispatch.ts` (top-level agent node) and `runAgent` in `loop.ts`
  (loop body). The three `handleAgentHitl` sites and the `runLoop` site in
  `executeLoopNode` survive — `loop_test.ts` calls `runLoop` directly and so
  bypasses the dispatch site. A broken site fails LOUDLY (the engine falls
  back to the real adapter and tries to spawn an agent process), so the gap
  costs a confusing failure, not a silent pass.
- **Handler contract:** `(call) => RuntimeInvokeResult | Promise<…>` where
  `call` carries `opts` (assert on it), `index`/`history` (turn number and
  prior invocations), `reply()`/`fail()` (reply builders — with and without
  `CliRunOutput`), `write()` (artifact relative to the invocation `cwd`), and
  `sleep()` (rejects on `opts.signal`, so FR-E80 abort paths are testable
  without dangling timers). Throwing emulates an adapter crash; `invoke` is
  `async` so the throw surfaces as a rejection.
- **Anti-drift:** capabilities default to
  `getRuntimeAdapter(id).capabilitiesFor("acp")` with per-test overrides.
  Default id is `opencode` — it keeps the `claude --version` preflight
  (FR-E81) out of tests.
- **Boundary:** no workflow-config surface (`workflow.yaml` cannot select a
  fake) and excluded from the JSR tarball via `deno.json#publish.exclude`.
  ACP-front behaviour (handshake, wire errors, real process kill) is
  deliberately NOT emulated — that band belongs to `@korchasa/ai-ide-cli`.

### 3.94 Static Workflow Diagram (`scripts/workflow-diagram.ts`) — FR-E94

- **Input boundary:** Accept a workflow directory or direct YAML path. Parse
  only structural fields required for visualization; do not execute commands,
  interpolate templates, or require the external project's engine version.
  Read both forms of `fork` (FR-E95) — the `"<group>.<branch>"` string and the
  object with `group`/`branches` — without normalising one into the other.
- **Graph model:** Assign deterministic Mermaid-safe identifiers in YAML node
  order. Reduce each node's `inputs` to immediate dependencies by removing an
  input when another declared input already depends on it. Infer an omitted
  phase only when all known adjacent phases agree; report the inference in
  prose. Separate `run_on` nodes into a post-workflow group. Represent loop
  bodies as contained nodes with their internal dependency edges.
- **Primary view:** For an `.html` output path, flatten the config with
  `flattenNodes` — every top-level node plus the body nodes of every loop,
  under `"<loop>/<body>"` ids — compute a left-to-right DAG rank over that
  flattened graph, and emit one self-contained interactive SVG canvas. A body
  node no sibling precedes takes its loop as its input, which draws the
  containment edge the Mermaid view spells out as `-. contains .->`; a body
  node inherits the phase of the loop that owns it, since a `phases:` block
  never names a body node.
  Curved edges connect explicit prerequisites; node cards carry input/output
  ports, type color, operation, stable ID, phase, and an execution summary.
  Pointer drag pans, wheel/buttons zoom, and Fit restores the whole graph.
  Selecting a node fills a right-hand inspector from the complete unabridged
  node config, including commands, prompts, gates, hooks, validation, fork and
  join membership, loops, and overrides. No Mermaid HTML-label behavior is involved.
- **Completeness guard:** Compare keys recursively against the supported
  workflow schema. Unknown workflow/default/node/settings/fork/validation
  fields produce an explicit incomplete marker and path-specific warnings, so
  schema growth cannot silently disappear from visualization. Prompt bodies are
  summarized by line count and opening line; executable shell text remains
  exact after YAML whitespace folding.
- **Compatibility view:** Non-HTML paths retain the Markdown/Mermaid renderer.
  Both renderers are static and have no browser, workflow-execution, or network
  dependency.
