# SRS: Engine — Index

Functional requirements for the domain-agnostic DAG executor engine. Split
across section files in [requirements-engine/](requirements-engine/) to fit
within the `Read` tool's 10k-token limit (working budget ~8k tokens per file).
FR-IDs are stable — never renumber them on move.

## Sections

  worktree (FR-E91), journal hash chain (FR-E92), HITL node type (FR-E93).

  — Which `RuntimeInvokeOptions` fields may cross the ACP wire, and what
  the engine does with the ones that may not (FR-E98).
- [13-session-continuation.md](requirements-engine/13-session-continuation.md)

  binary precondition + release distribution (FR-E78), and the MCP
  `start_run` tool (FR-E84).
