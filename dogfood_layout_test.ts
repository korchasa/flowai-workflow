/**
 * @module
 * Dogfood-only sanity tests for the multi-workflow layout (FR-S47/DoD-2).

 * Asserts that this repository hosts exactly the three expected workflow
 * folders directly under `.flowai-workflow/`, each with a `workflow.yaml`,
 * and that no stray files or other directories live at that level.
 *
 * These tests target the engine's own dogfood configuration; they do NOT
 * gate end-user projects (which may have any number of workflow folders
 * and only need to satisfy {@link assertWorkflowFolderShape}).
