  removed; use `ForkConfig` and `{{branch.*}}`.

### Features

### [0.8.5](https://github.com/korchasa/flowai-workflow/compare/v0.8.4...v0.8.5) (2026-07-26)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **engine:** workflow arguments must use the attached form
`--key=value`. The detached form made every mistyped engine flag silent:
`--dryrun` was read as a workflow argument and swallowed the next token.
* **engine:** `defaults.max_parallel` defaults to 1 (sequential) instead
of unlimited. All nodes of a run share one worktree, so the FR-E50
guardrail cannot attribute file changes across concurrent nodes; set the
value explicitly to opt back into concurrency.

## [0.7.0](https://github.com/korchasa/flowai-workflow/compare/v0.6.0...v0.7.0) (2026-04-30)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **engine:** state.ts no longer exports setPhaseRegistry,
clearPhaseRegistry, or getPhaseForNode. Replace with
PhaseRegistry.fromConfig(config) and registry.get(nodeId). The
optional phaseRegistry parameter on getNodeDir/buildTaskPaths is
back-compat for callers that omit it (flat path returned).

* **init:** `flowai-workflow init` flag surface changed.
Removed: --template, --answers. Added: --workflow, --list/-l.
Placeholder substitution (__PROJECT_NAME__, __WORKFLOW_NAME__,
__TEST_CMD__, etc.) is gone — files copy verbatim. Wizard prompts
are gone — workflow selection is the only interactive step.
.template.json metadata is no longer written.

* **cli:** `flowai-workflow` with no args no longer launches an
interactive REPL — it prints usage and exits non-zero. Compiled
binaries no longer embed `repl/skills/` via `deno compile --include`.

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/korchasa/flowai-workflow/compare/v0.3.3...v0.4.0) (2026-04-26)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **engine:** workflow folder is now a mandatory positional argument
to the `run` subcommand: `flowai-workflow run <workflow> [options]`.
Both `--config <path>` and the transitional `--workflow <dir>` flag
are removed. Autodetect is dropped — the path must always be supplied
explicitly. Migration: drop `--workflow ` from any existing invocation.

- cli.ts::parseArgs: first non-flag token becomes config_path; flags
  may appear before or after; trailing slash normalized; second
  positional rejected. Both `--config` and `--workflow` flags throw
  pointing at the positional form.
- cli.ts::runEngine: enforces presence of config_path with
  "Missing workflow argument" error; drops listWorkflows/
  resolveWorkflowConfigPath/DEFAULT_WORKFLOW_ROOT.
- Help text + Examples updated.
- Callsites: deno.json#tasks.run, scripts/self-runner.ts, init/mod.ts
  success message all switched to positional form.
- Docs: SRS (FR-E53 rewritten; FR-E5 + FR-E9 + FR-S46 + FR-E40 evidence
  refreshed), SDS engine §3 CLI synopsis, README CLI Flags + examples,
  AGENTS/CLAUDE drift caveat, CHANGELOG Unreleased entry merged.

* **engine+sdlc:** `.flowai-workflow/<name>/` is now the unit of consolidation;
flat `.flowai-workflow/workflow.yaml` is no longer supported. CLI flag
`--config <path>` is removed in favor of `--workflow <dir>` (autodetected
when exactly one folder exists; friendly error on 0 or >1).

- Engine: thread `workflowDir` through `state.ts` (getRunDir/getNodeDir/
  getStatePath/getLogsDir/buildTaskPaths/saveState/loadState) and
  `engine.ts`/`node-dispatch.ts`/`post-workflow.ts`. Add
  `deriveWorkflowDir(configPath)` (FR-E9 update; DoD-14).
- CLI: replace `--config` with `--workflow <dir>`; add `listWorkflows()`
  and `resolveWorkflowConfigPath()` autodetect (DoD-4).
- Dogfood: migrate to three sibling workflow folders —
  `github-inbox/`, `github-inbox-opencode/`, `github-inbox-opencode-test/` —
  each self-contained (workflow.yaml + agents/ + memory/ + scripts/).
  Remove obsolete `.flowai-workflow/scripts/lib*.sh` and
  `reset-to-main*.sh` (DoD-2, DoD-3).
- Init template: add `WORKFLOW_NAME` answer (default `default`); template
  destinations support `__WORKFLOW_NAME__` placeholder substitution (DoD-7).
- Checks: `assertWorkflowFolderShape()` validates each folder; `agents/`
  required only when `workflow.yaml` references it. `noClaudeAgentsRefs()`
  scans `.ts/.yaml/.yml/.json` outside `documents/` (DoD-1, DoD-6).
- New tests: `dogfood_layout_test.ts`, expanded `state_test.ts`/`cli_test.ts`/
  `scripts/check_test.ts`, `init/integration_test.ts` WORKFLOW_NAME case.
- One-shot migration: `scripts/migrate-state-paths.ts` (idempotent;
  DoD-13).
- Docs: update SRS (FR-S47, FR-E53, FR-E5/E9, FR-S46; mark FR-S17 and
  FR-S26 superseded), README (workflow folder section + project tree),
  AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md (three-folder dogfood + drift caveat),
  CHANGELOG (BREAKING + migration cookbook).
- Gitignore: ignore `.flowai-workflow/*/memory/agent-*.md` (runtime
  reflection state); `memory/reflection-protocol.md` remains tracked.
  Untrack legacy `.flowai-workflow/runs/` artifacts.

`deno task check`: 789 passed | 0 failed.

* refactor!: extract ai-ide-cli to standalone repository

The @korchasa/ai-ide-cli library now lives in its own repository at
github.com/korchasa/ai-ide-cli. Engine depends on it one-way via JSR
(jsr:@korchasa/ai-ide-cli@^0.2.0, pinned in engine/deno.json). For
local development the root workspace deno.json uses the `links` field
to resolve the JSR specifier from a sibling checkout
(`../ai-ide-cli`), so contributor experience stays the same as with
the former workspace layout.

Rationale: the library already had a one-way dependency from engine
and was published separately on JSR. Splitting the repositories
removes release-cadence coupling (engine and library can bump
independently), isolates issue trackers and CI, and lets each package
follow its own evolution timeline.

Scope of this commit:
- Remove `ai-ide-cli/` from the workspace (`deno.json`: workspace
  drops the member, `links` added pointing at `../ai-ide-cli`).
- `engine/deno.json`: add JSR import pin for `@korchasa/ai-ide-cli`.
- Delete the `ai-ide-cli/` subtree (history preserved in the sibling
  repo via `git filter-repo --subdirectory-filter`).
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: drop the ai-ide-cli publish and
  publish-dry-run steps (moved to the sibling repo's CI).
- `.versionrc.json`: drop `ai-ide-cli/deno.json` from bumpFiles —
  `engine/deno.json` is the sole canonical version source now.
- `scripts/check.ts`: remove the delegated library check block.
- Docs updated to reflect the split: AGENTS.md, documents/AGENTS.md,
  FR-E44 description/acceptance, design-engine module-core refs,
  design-sdlc init delegation note.

Verification: `deno task check` green, `deno task test` 3004 passed,
0 failed. Library-side `deno task check` green in sibling repo.

Breaking: consumers that depended on the monorepo's `ai-ide-cli/`
paths must switch to the JSR spec (already recommended). No code
rename on either side.

* fix(ci): remove `links` from checked-in deno.json

Keep `@korchasa/ai-ide-cli` resolved via JSR in CI and publish
dry-run — a committed `links` override would (a) require a sibling
checkout in every CI job and (b) mask version drift because local
source differs from the JSR-pinned version.

Documented the manual dev-time override in AGENTS.md: clone both
repos side by side and add `"links": ["../ai-ide-cli"]` to the
workspace root as a local, uncommitted change when iterating across
the two packages.

Also drop the stale `.flowai-workflow/worktrees/` side effect from
the prior run — already gitignored, the harness was picking up
stale copies with pre-extraction import maps.

* fix(ci): regenerate deno.lock without stale npm:yaml

The previous lock carried an orphaned `npm:yaml@2` entry (marked
`bin: true`) from a removed dependency. CI's fresh-cache run tried to
resolve its binary export and failed with
"Failed resolving binary export '.../yaml/2.8.2/package.json' did not
exist" before any user code ran. Local runs worked because the cache
was warm.

Lock regenerated from the current source imports; npm section is now
empty.
